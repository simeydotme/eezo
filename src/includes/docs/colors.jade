            Eezo comes with the ability to change colours of some
            properties such as **text**, **background-color**
            and **borders**. The colours can also be customised in sass
            by changing the default values or adding more colours.




    +sub-title( "Default Colours" )

        These are the default colours that come with Eezo, they are
        mostly just nice defaults for general UI purposes
        with a slightly cool hue for greys.

        The `black` and `white` colors are both set
        to a *"nicer"* shade with no saturation. And the greys are 
        slightly saturated with a cool hue. [why? read 
        this.](http://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/)

        The extra colours are just some *"pretty OK"*
        colours to jump-start your ui. They only come with 
        the <strong class="txt-sans">Core+</strong> bundle
        and can be easily overridden with customisation in sass.
